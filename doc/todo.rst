To do
*****

- catch exceptions and give nicer messages (e.g. create a project with an existing name, install default with existing name
- add a new-command script that creates a new command (--next-to=gitsplit)
- configure which python version to use in local project's virtualenv
- completion not working inside braces

Nice to have
------------
- allow to tag the co9mmand in its meta file, and list commands with certain tags
